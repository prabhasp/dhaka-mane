A minimum spanning tree of the canvas is generated using [randomized depth-first traversal](/mbostock/1ef3b1fb9eb35ca8ffff). Hue encodes [Manhattan distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) from the start. (This is not an optimal visual encoding, but it suffices and is pretty.)

Randomized depth-first traversal can also be used to generate mazes. See a maze generated with randomized depth-first traversal [flooded with color](/mbostock/97f1cdb9e0a695cd8df4), and compare color floods of spanning trees generated by [Prim’s algorithm](/mbostock/11377353), [Wilson’s algorithm](/mbostock/11363008) and [random traversal](/mbostock/11337835).

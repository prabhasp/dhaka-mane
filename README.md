A [spanning tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) of the canvas is generated using [random traversal](/mbostock/70a28267db0354261476) and then flooded with color. Hue encodes [Manhattan distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) from the root of the tree. (This is not an optimal visual encoding, but it suffices and is pretty.)

Spanning trees can also be used to generate mazes. See a maze generated with randomized depth-first traversal [flooded with color](/mbostock/97f1cdb9e0a695cd8df4), and compare color floods of spanning trees generated by [random traversal](/mbostock/11337835), [Prim’s algorithm](/mbostock/11377353), and [Wilson’s algorithm](/mbostock/11363008).
